# hopitor
This is the code for running the host-pathogen protein-protein interaction prediction method (HOPITOR) as part of the paper 
Abdul Hannan Basit, Wajid Abbasi, Amina Asif, Sadaf Gull, and Fayyaz ul Amir Afsar Minhas- "Training host-pathogen protein-protein interaction predictors" (pre-print release).

Requirements: Python 2.7, sklearn v. 0.19+, XGBoost library (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/xgboost). We recommend the anaconda distribution for python (https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

Running the code: Use the hopitor.py python file and enter the host and viral protein sequences as shown in the example. The code requires the classifier file 'xg-final.pkl' to be in the same directory for generating the predictions.
